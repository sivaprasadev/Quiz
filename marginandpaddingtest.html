        <h1>What is a Web Application</h1>
    
    <p>
        A Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface.
        Web services are Web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain Web apps. According to Web.AppStorm editor Jarel Remick, 
        any website component that performs some function for the user qualifies as a Web app.

        Web applications can be designed for a wide variety of uses and can be used by anyone;
        from an organization to an individual for numerous reasons. Commonly used Web applications
        can include webmail, online calculators, or e-commerce shops. Some Web apps can be only
        accessed by a specific browser; however, most are available no matter the browser.
